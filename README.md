# Python web browser

A simple Python web browser.

Iteratively added complexity in successive versions.

## Set up environment

For initial setup, create a virtual environment & run it:

```bash
$ python -m venv venv
$ . venv/bin/activate
```

Then install requirements:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In subsequent setups, just run the second venv line to activate the virtual environment.

## Run browser

```bash
$ python pybrowser.py
```

Add numbers as appropriate to run successive versions.
